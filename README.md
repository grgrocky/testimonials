## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

This project helped me to understand the basic knowledge specially to used the grid layout. Grid Layout is more about parent controlling. 

Quite challanging to position the background image of svg file, but i managed to do it. 

#daniel {
    background-color: var(--moderate_violet);
    background-image: url(./images/bg-pattern-quotation.svg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: 229px 0px;
    background-size: 7.8rem;
    color: var(--white);
}

### Continued development

I will be focusing on more grid layout in future.
